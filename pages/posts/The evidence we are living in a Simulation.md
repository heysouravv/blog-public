# The evidence we are living in a Simulation

Simulation theory suggests our reality is likely artificial. Evidence is philosophical, not scientific, but simulations are widely used.

We might be living in a simulation.

- We might be living in an artificial reality
- The Mandela Effect and simulation theory
- Everything in nature follows patterns and rules, like a program.
- Simulation of an entire universe requires enormous computing power
- Our reality may be rendered like a video game
- Particles change behavior when observed
- Simulation theory and God are not so different.

We might be living in a simulation.

- The idea of the universe being a simulation is not new and is supported by modern simulation theory.
- Scientists believe there is a 50/50 chance that we are living in base reality versus a simulated reality.

We might be living in an artificial reality

- The universe was dormant before someone decided to boot up a program
- Simulation theory is believed by respected scientists, technologists, and philosophers
- The Mandela Effect suggests that other realities may be bleeding into ours

The Mandela Effect and simulation theory

- Many people have false memories, known as the Mandela Effect
- Some believe this is due to glitches in a computer-programmed reality
- Deja vu may be the simulation correcting itself with new information
- Fermi's Paradox questions why we haven't found evidence of other civilizations
- Max Tegmark and James Gates suggest the strict laws of physics point to a simulation

Everything in nature follows patterns and rules, like a program.

- Computer code is embedded in the fabric of the cosmos and can be found in DNA.
- Fibonacci numbers and the golden ratio are prevalent in nature, from seashells to the human body.
- Scientists have inadvertently provided evidence for simulation theory by proving that everything in the universe follows patterns and rules.
- Moore's Law predicts that computing power will continue to increase exponentially, bringing us closer to the ability to simulate an entire universe.

Simulation of an entire universe requires enormous computing power

- Human intelligence may not have the capacity to simulate a universe
- Simulation theory supporters suggest using techniques similar to video game engines
- Proof of simulation theory is yet to be found

Our reality may be rendered like a video game

- The double-slit experiment supports this theory
- Particles passing through two slits create clumping patterns, but waves create an interference pattern
- Adding a detector changes the pattern, suggesting that observation affects reality

Particles change behavior when observed

- John Wheeler's delayed choice experiment shows particles behave differently when observed.
- Observing photons from distant galaxies alters their state back in time.

Simulation theory and God are not so different.

- The laws of physics only make sense if there's a program at work.
- Simulation theory creator and God both exist outside our understanding of space and time.

### **Words that matter >**

- Moore’s Law
    - Moore's Law is the observation that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles about every two years.
    - It is an empirical relationship linked to gains from experience in production.
    - Moore's prediction has been used in the semiconductor industry to guide long-term planning and to set targets for research and development.
    - Advancements in digital electronics are strongly linked to Moore's law.
- Dyson Sphere
    - What is a Dyson sphere?:
        - A hypothetical megastructure that encompasses a star and captures a large percentage of its solar power output.
        - Enables a civilization to harvest far more energy than what can be generated from the home planet's resources alone.
    - Origins of the concept:
        - First formalized by Freeman Dyson in his 1960 Science paper 'Search for Artificial Stellar Sources of Infra-Red Radiation'.
        - Dyson theorized that as the energy requirements of an advanced technological civilization increased, there would come a time when it would need to systematically harvest the energy from its local star on a large scale.
    - Search for megastructures:
        - Dyson-style energy collectors around a distant star would absorb and re-radiate energy from the star.
        - If the percentage of such atypical wavelengths were to be significant, an alien megastructure could be detected at interstellar distances.
    - SETI has looked for such infrared-heavy spectra from solar analogs, as has Fermilab.
    Feasibility and science-based speculation:
        - Building a stable megastructure around the sun is currently far beyond humanity's engineering capacity.
        - Some have suggested that Dyson sphere habitats could be built around white dwarfs and even pulsars.
        - Stellar engines are hypothetical megastructures whose purpose is to extract useful energy from a star.
    - Fictional accounts:
        - A precursor to the concept of Dyson spheres was featured in the 1937 novel Star Maker by Olaf Stapledon.
        - Fictional Dyson spheres are typically solid structures forming a continuous shell around the star in question.
    - Dyson spheres appear as a background element in many works of fiction.
    Introduction:
        - The concept of a Dyson sphere was first proposed by physicist Freeman Dyson in 1960.
        - It is a hypothetical megastructure that would completely encompass a star and harness its energy output.
    - Search for Extraterrestrial Life:
        - The search for extraterrestrial life has led to the consideration of Dyson spheres as a possible sign of advanced civilizations.
        - Several searches for Dyson spheres have been conducted, but none have been found so far.
    - Recent Developments:
        - In 2015, astronomers discovered a star with unusual brightness fluctuations that sparked speculation about the possibility of a Dyson sphere.
        - However, subsequent research has suggested that the fluctuations were likely caused by natural phenomena rather than a Dyson sphere.
    - Feasibility:
        - The construction of a Dyson sphere would require an enormous amount of resources and technological advancement.
        - Alternative proposals for harnessing a star's energy include Dyson swarms and Dyson bubbles.
    - In Popular Culture:
        - The concept of a Dyson sphere has been featured in numerous works of science fiction, including Star Trek and Halo.
        - It has also been the subject of scientific and philosophical discussions about the future of human civilization.
    - Conclusion:
        - The idea of a Dyson sphere remains a fascinating concept in science and science fiction.
        - While it may be unlikely that we will discover evidence of a Dyson sphere in the near future, the search for extraterrestrial life continues to inspire new ideas and possibilities.
    - **Stellar Engine**
        - Stellar engines are hypothetical megastructures:
        - Stellar engines are megastructures that use the resources of a star to generate available work.
        - They can produce mechanical, electrical, or chemical work or use the impulse of the light emitted by the star to produce thrust.
        - There are three classes of stellar engines:
            - Class A (Shkadov thruster) is a stellar propulsion system that uses an enormous mirror/light sail to balance gravitational attraction towards and radiation pressure away from the star.
            - Class B consists of two concentric spheres around a star that receive energy from the star and become hotter than the outer sphere, driving thermal engines to provide mechanical work.
            - Class C combines the propulsive aspects of the Shkadov thruster and the energy-generating aspects of a class-B engine.
        - Stellar engines can make builders a type-II civilization on the Kardashev scale:
            - The creation of a stellar engine would make its builders a type-II civilization on the Kardashev scale.
            - This means that they would be able to harness the energy of their entire star system.
        - The Shkadov thruster is a simple example of a stellar engine:
            - The Shkadov thruster is a type of class-A stellar engine that uses an enormous mirror/light sail to balance gravitational attraction towards and radiation pressure away from the star.
            - The excess radiation pressure acts as net thrust, accelerating the star in the direction of the hovering statite.
            - Any planetary system attached to the star would be "dragged" along by its parent star.
        - Class-B stellar engines are not propulsive:
            - A class-B stellar engine consists of two concentric spheres around a star that receive energy from the star and become hotter than the outer sphere, driving thermal engines to provide mechanical work.
            - Unlike the Shkadov thruster, a class-B stellar engine is not propulsive.
        - Class-C stellar engines combine the propulsive and energy-generating aspects of stellar engines:
            - A class-C stellar engine combines the propulsive aspects of the Shkadov thruster and the energy-generating aspects of a class-B engine.
            - It employs both a higher temperature Dyson shell partially covered by a mirror and an outer sphere at a lower temperature.
            - The non-spherical mirror ensures conversion of light impulse into effective thrust while the difference of temperature may be used to convert star energy into mechanical work.
        - The Caplan thruster uses concentrated stellar energy to create beams of solar wind:
            - The Caplan thruster uses concentrated stellar energy to excite certain regions of the outer surface of the star and create beams of solar wind for collection by a multi-Bussard ramjet assembly.
            - The ramjets would produce directed plasma to stabilize its orbit and jets of oxygen-14 to push the star.
            - Using rudimentary calculations that assume maximum efficiency, Caplan estimates that the Bussard engine would use 10 kg of solar material per second to produce a maximum acceleration of 10 m/s.
        - Stellar engines are different from Dyson spheres:
            - Stellar engines are different megastructures than the Dyson spheres, which are not specifically designed to generate available work.
        - Stellar Engine:
            - A hypothetical megastructure that could harness the energy of a star.
            - It would involve building a series of mirrors or lenses to focus the star's energy into a beam that could be directed to a power plant.
- Delayed Choice Experiment
    - Wheeler's delayed-choice experiment:
        - A series of thought experiments in quantum physics proposed by John Archibald Wheeler.
        - Attempts to decide whether light somehow "senses" the experimental apparatus in the double-slit experiment it travels through, adjusting its behavior to fit by assuming an appropriate determinate state, or whether light remains in an indeterminate state, exhibiting both wave-like and particle-like behavior until measured.
    - Complementarity principle:
        - The 'particle-like' or 'wave-like' properties of a photon can be measured, but not both at the same time.
        - Detection of a photon is generally a destructive process.
        - The photon is said to have traveled as a wave if the build up results in the typical interference pattern of waves.
    - Quantum mechanics predicts that the photon always travels as a wave.
    Simple interferometer:
        - One way to investigate the question of when a photon decides whether to act as a wave or a particle in an experiment is to use the interferometer method.
        - Experimenters generally say that each photon has behaved as a particle from the time of its emission to the time of its detection, has traveled by either one path or the other, and further affirm that its wave nature has not been exhibited.
        - Experimenters must explain interference phenomena as consequences of the wave nature of light.
        - Wheeler wanted to know whether, experimentally, a time could be determined at which the photon made its "decision."
    - Albert Einstein's view:
        - Albert Einstein did not like the possible consequences of quantum mechanics.
        Cosmic interferometer:
            - Double quasar known as QSO 0957+561, also known as the "Twin Quasar," was used as a cosmic interferometer to test the wave-particle duality of light.
            The experiment supported the wave theory of light.
    - Wheeler's Plan:
        - Theoreticians suggested that information about whether there was or was not a second beam-splitter installed could somehow be transmitted from the end point of the experimental device back to the photon as it was just entering that experimental device.
        - Wheeler proposed a cosmic version of his experiment, asking what would happen if a quasar or other galaxy millions or billions of light years away from Earth passes its light around an intervening galaxy or cluster of galaxies that would act as a gravitational lens.
    - Paths Separated and Paths Converged via Beam-Splitter:
        - Wheeler suggested that perhaps for those experimental results to be obtained would mean that at the instant astronomers inserted their beam-splitter, photons that had left the quasar some millions of years ago retroactively decided to travel as waves.
        - Several ways of implementing Wheeler's basic idea have been made into real experiments and they support the conclusion that Wheeler anticipated — that what is done at the exit port of the experimental device before the photon is detected will determine whether it displays interference phenomena or not.
    - Double-Slit Version:
        - A second kind of experiment resembles the ordinary double-slit experiment.
        The retrocausal explanation, which Wheeler does not accept, says that with the detection screen in place, interference must be manifested.
    - Bohmian Interpretation:
        - Bohm et al. have shown that the Bohmian interpretation gives a straightforward account of the behaviour of the particle under the delayed-choice set up, without resorting to such a radical explanation.
        - In Bohm's quantum mechanics, the particle obeys classical mechanics except that its movement takes place under the additional influence of its quantum potential.
    - Quantum potential and experimental set up:
        - The quantum potential contains information about the boundary conditions defining the system, and hence any change of the experimental set up is immediately recognized by the quantum potential, and determines the dynamics of the Bohmian particle.
        - Jacques et al. claimed that an experiment of theirs follows fully the original scheme proposed by Wheeler.
    - Delayed choice quantum experiment:
        - John Wheeler's original discussion of the possibility of a delayed choice quantum appeared in an essay entitled "Law Without Law."
        - The experiment involves light finding its way from one corner of a rectangular array of semi-silvered and fully silvered mirrors to the other corner, and then can be made to reveal itself not only as having gone halfway around the perimeter by a single path and then exited, but also as having gone both ways around the perimeter and then to have "made a choice" as to whether to exit by one port or the other.
    - Interference is impossible when measuring in an open configuration.
    Interferometer in the lab:
        - The Wheeler version of the interferometer experiment could not be performed in a laboratory until recently because of the practical difficulty of inserting or removing the second beam-splitter in the brief time interval between the photon's entering the first beam-splitter and its arrival at the location provided for the second beam-splitter.
        - A high-speed switchable device on one path makes it possible to divert that path away from its ordinary destination so that path effectively comes to a dead end.
        Wheeler's interpretation of the physical results would be that in one configuration of the two experiments a single copy of the wavefunction of an entering photon is received, with 50% probability, at one or the other detectors, and that under the other configuration two copies of the wave function, traveling over different paths, arrive at both detectors, are out of phase with each other, and therefore exhibit interference.
    - Interferometer in the cosmos:
        - The cosmic experiment envisioned by Wheeler could be described either as analogous to the interferometer experiment or as analogous to a double-slit experiment.
        - The main difficulty in performing this experiment is that the experimenter has no control over or knowledge of when each photon began its trip toward earth, and the experimenter does not know the lengths of each of the two paths between the distant quasar.
        - One suggestion for synchronizing inputs from the two ends of this cosmic experimental apparatus lies in the characteristics of quasars and the possibility of identifying identical events of some signal characteristic.
    - Double-slits in lab and cosmos:
        - Wheeler's version of the double-slit experiment is arranged so that the same photon that emerges from two slits can be detected in two ways.
        - The technical problem in the laboratory is how to insert a detector screen at a point appropriate to observe interference effects or to remove that screen to reveal the photon detectors that can be restricted to receiving photons from the narrow regions of space where the slits are found.
        - The cosmic version of the interferometer experiment could easily be adapted to function as a cosmic double-slit device.
    - Current experiments of interest:
        - The first real experiment to follow Wheeler's intention for a delayed choice quantum experiment was conducted by scientists in 2018.
        - The experiment involved using a laser to create a pair of entangled photons, which were then sent to separate telescopes 18 kilometers apart.
        - The experiment showed that the choice of measurement made on one photon could affect the measurement made on the other photon, even when the two photons were separated by a distance of 18 kilometers.
    - Detection method for slit apparatus:
        - The end-game determination of detection method for slit apparatus is the one by Walborn et al.
    - Practical difficulties of interstellar Wheeler experiment:
        - Researchers with access to radio telescopes originally designed for SETI research have explicated the practical difficulties of conducting the interstellar Wheeler experiment.
    - Confirmation of standard predictions of quantum mechanics:
        - A recent experiment by Manning et al. confirms the standard predictions of standard quantum mechanics with an atom of Helium.
    - Summary of experiments from Wheeler's proposals:
        - Ma, Zeilinger et al. have summarized what can be known as a result of experiments that have arisen from Wheeler's proposals.
        - Any explanation of what goes on in a specific individual observation of one photon has to take into account the whole experimental apparatus of the complete quantum state consisting of both photons, and it can only make sense after all information concerning complementary variables has been recorded.
        - The viewpoint that the system photon behaves either definitely as a wave or definitely as a particle would require faster-than-light communication, which would be in strong tension with the special theory of relativity.
    - Delayed-choice quantum eraser:
        - The delayed-choice quantum eraser is a related experiment that uses Bell inequalities to replace the delayed choice devices.
    - Wheeler-Feynman time-symmetric theory:
        - The Wheeler-Feynman time-symmetric theory is another related theory.
- **Retro Causality**
    - Retrocausality is a concept of cause and effect in which an effect precede its cause in time and so a later event affects an earlier one.
    - Philosophical efforts to understand causality extend back at leat to Aristotle's discussions of the four causes.
    - In the 1950s, Michael Dummett wrote in opposition to such definitions, stating that there was no philosophical objection to effects preceding their causes.
    - Physics:
        - Aspects of modern physics, such as the hypothetical tachyon particle and certain time-independent aspects of quantum mechanics, may allow particles or information to travel backward in time.
        - Closed timelike curves, in which the world line of an object returns to its origin, arise from some exact solutions to the Einstein field equation.
        - Logical objections to macroscopic time travel may not necessarily prevent retrocausality at other scales of interaction.
    - Relativity:
        - Extreme environments of spacetime, such as a traversable wormhole or the region near certain cosmic strings, may allow the formation of closed timelike curves, implying a theoretical possibility of retrocausality.
        - The exotic matter or topological defects required for the creation of those environments have not been observed.
        - The chronology protection conjecture of Stephen Hawking suggests that any such closed timelike curve would be destroyed before it could be used.
    - Quantum physics:
        - Retrocausality is associated with the Double Inferential state-Vector Formalism (DIVF), later known as the two-state vector formalism (TSVF) in quantum mechanics.
        - Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory, proposed by John Archibald Wheeler and Richard Feynman, uses retrocausality and a temporal form of destructive interference to explain the absence of a type of converging concentric wave suggested by certain solutions to Maxwell's equations.
        - Retrocausality is sometimes associated with the nonlocal correlations that generically arise from quantum entanglement, including for example the delayed choice quantum eraser.
    - Quantum gravity:
        - Quantum gravity requires a reconciliation of both relativity and quantum physics.
        It has been suggested that a classical notion of a causal structure is untenable in any framework compatible with the basic principles of quantum mechanics and classical general relativity.
        - A Bell-type theorem provides a basis by which this could in principle be experimentally tested.
    - Tachyons:
        - Hypothetical superluminal particles called tachyons have a spacelike trajectory, and thus can appear to move backward in time, according to an observer in a conventional reference frame.
        - Despite frequent depiction in science fiction as a method to send messages back in time, tachyons do not interact with normal tardyonic matter in a way that would violate standard causality.
    - Parapsychology:
        - Retrocausality is claimed to occur in some psychic phenomena such as precognition.
        Such results and their underlying theories have been rejected by the mainstream scientific community and are widely accepted as pseudoscience.
    - Challenges and Controversies:
        - The concept of retrocausality is still highly controversial and many scientists remain skeptical of its possibility.
        - Some argue that retrocausality would violate the laws of physics, such as the principle of causality and the second law of thermodynamics.
        - Others argue that retrocausality may be possible, but only under highly specific and unlikely conditions.
    - Implications and Applications:
        - If retrocausality were possible, it could have significant implications for our understanding of causality and the nature of time.
        - It could also have practical applications, such as in the development of time travel technology.
        - However, these applications are purely speculative and would require a much deeper understanding of the nature of retrocausality.
    - Conclusion:
        - The concept of retrocausality remains a topic of debate and research in both philosophy and science.
        - While some argue that it is impossible, others believe that it may be possible under certain conditions.
        - Further research and experimentation will be necessary to fully understand the nature and implications of retrocausality.
    - Introduction to Retrocausality:
        - Retrocausality is a concept in physics that suggests that the future can influence the past.
        - The idea of retrocausality has been explored in various scientific studies and experiments.
    - Scientific Studies on Retrocausality:
        - Several studies have been conducted to explore the concept of retrocausality.
        - Some of these studies include experiments on remote intercessory prayer and psychokinesis.
    - Criticism of Retrocausality:
        - Despite the scientific studies on retrocausality, the concept remains controversial.
        Critics argue that there is no scientific evidence to support the idea of retrocausality.
